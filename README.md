<h1>LinkedIn Message Automation</h1>
<p>
LinkedIn automation is everywhere. You’ve probably heard of it. And all about how valuable it can be for outreach and generating leads.
It can save you hours, if not days, of messaging people and really skyrocket your social selling.
Imagine not having to message your leads one-by-one and being able to automate sending a connection request to all the CEOs in your area who work in tech and marketing.

  <h1>Why Automate LinkedIn</h1>
  <P>
  Wondering why people choose to automate LinkedIn in the first place?It’s simple really. Let’s say you want to start generating leads via LinkedIn.
  You already know who your target audience is and you’re ready to start messaging them.
  There are two ways you can do this.
  You can manually run a search for your target audience on LinkedIn and start writing a personal message one-by-one. You’d visit their profiles, click on the ‘Connect’ button,     and type up your request message. 
  But the next thing you know – you’ve wasted up to an hour, and you still have a long way to go. </p>
